  abstract ={Understanding of animal collectives is limited by the ability to track each individual. We describe an algorithm and software that extract all trajectories from video, with high identification accuracy for collectives of up to 100 individuals. idtracker.ai uses two convolutional networks: one that detects when animals touch or cross and another for animal identification. The tool is trained with a protocol that adapts to video conditions and tracking difficulty.},

  abstract ={Animals in groups touch each other, move in paths that cross, and interact in complex ways. Current video tracking methods sometimes switch identities of unmarked individuals during these interactions. These errors propagate and result in random assignments after a few minutes unless manually corrected. We present idTracker, a multitracking algorithm that extracts a characteristic fingerprint from each animal in a video recording of a group. It then uses these fingerprints to identify every individual throughout the video. Tracking by identification prevents propagation of errors, and the correct identities can be maintained indefinitely. idTracker distinguishes animals even when humans cannot, such as for size-matched siblings, and reidentifies animals after they temporarily disappear from view or across different videos. It is robust, easy to use and general. We tested it on fish (Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes), flies (Drosophila melanogaster), ants (Messor structor) and mice (Mus musculus).},

	abstract = {The human genome encodes \~{}70 Rab GTPases that localize to the surfaces of distinct membrane compartments. To investigate the mechanism of Rab localization, chimeras containing heterologous Rab hypervariable domains were generated, and their ability to bind seven Rab effectors was quantified. Two chimeras could bind effectors for two distinctly localized Rabs; a Rab5/9 hybrid bound both Rab5 and Rab9 effectors, and a Rab1/9 hybrid bound to certain Rab1 and Rab9 effectors. These unusual chimeras permitted a test of the importance of effector binding for Rab localization. In both cases, changing the cellular concentration of a key Rab9 effector, which is called tail-interacting protein of 47 kD, moved a fraction of the proteins from their parental Rab localization to that of Rab9. Thus, relative concentrations of certain competing effectors could determine a chimera{\textquoteright}s localization. These data confirm the importance of effector interactions for Rab9 localization, and support a model in which effector proteins rely on Rabs as much as Rabs rely on effectors to achieve their correct steady state localizations.},

	abstract = {Background. Mobile health and digital medicine technologies are becoming increasingly used by individuals with common, chronic diseases to monitor their health. Numerous devices, sensors, and apps are available to patients and consumers -- some of which have been shown to lead to improved health management and health outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted which examine health care costs, and most have failed to provide study participants with a truly comprehensive monitoring system. Methods. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of adults who had submitted a 2012 health insurance claim associated with hypertension, diabetes, and/or cardiac arrhythmia. The intervention involved receipt of one or more mobile devices that corresponded to their condition(s) and an iPhone with linked tracking applications for a period of 6 months; the control group received a standard disease management program. Moreover, intervention study participants received access to an online health management system which provided participants detailed device tracking information over the course of the study. This was a monitoring system designed by leveraging collaborations with device manufacturers, a connected health leader, health care provider, and employee wellness program -- making it both unique and inclusive. We hypothesized that health resource utilization with respect to health insurance claims may be influenced by the monitoring intervention. We also examined health-self management. Results \&amp; Conclusions. There was little evidence of differences in health care costs or utilization as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, we found evidence that the control and intervention groups were equivalent with respect to most health care utilization outcomes. This result suggests there are not large short-term increases or decreases in health care costs or utilization associated with monitoring chronic health conditions using mobile health or digital medicine technologies. Among secondary outcomes there was some evidence of improvement in health self-management which was characterized by a decrease in the propensity to view health status as due to chance factors in the intervention group.

abstract = {From the Publisher: The worlds leading animation houses rely increasingly on subdivision methods for creating realistic-looking complex shapes. However, until now there was no one book devoted to this powerful geometric modeling technique. Subdivision Methods for Geometric Design does the job with authority and precision, providing all that is needed to understand how subdivision works its magic, and how to make that magic work. Throughout the book, icons cue readers to visit a companion Web site loaded with interactive exercises, implementations of the books images, and supplementary material. Rich in theory, analysis, and practical information, this book is the complete resource for subdivision methods. Features The result of a collaboration between a leading university researcher and an industry practitioner. The only book devoted exclusively and comprehensively to this important new technology. Provides solid background and theoretical analysis of subdivision as well as a wide variety of specific applications. Addresses algorithms for Bezier and uniform B-Spline curves, Catmull-Clark subdivision for quad meshes, and regularity tests for polyhedral meshes. Via the companion Web site, ( ), provides opportunities for readers to experiment hands-on with implementations in a richly interactive environment. Includes a foreword by Tony DeRose, recipient of the 1999 ACM Computer Graphics Achievement Award for his seminal work in subdivision methods. Author Biography: Joe Warren, Professor of Computer Science at Rice University since 1986, is one of the worlds leading experts on subdivision. Of his nearly 50 computer science papers-published in prestigious forums such as SIGGRAPH, Transactions on Graphics, Computer-Aided Geometric Design, and The Visual Computer-a dozen specifically address subdivision and its applications to computer graphics. Prof. Warren received both his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science at Cornell University. His research interests focus on mathematical methods for representing geometric shape. Henrik Weimer is a research scientist at the DaimlerChrysler Corporate Research Center in Berlin, where he works on knowledge-based support for the design and creation of engineering products. Dr. Weimer obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University.}

From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations.

  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

    abstract = { Mobile animal groups provide some of the most compelling examples of self-organization in the natural world. While field observations of songbird flocks wheeling in the sky or anchovy schools fleeing from predators have inspired considerable interest in the mechanics of collective motion, the challenge of simultaneously monitoring multiple animals in the field has historically limited our capacity to study collective behaviour of wild animal groups with precision. However, recent technological advancements now present exciting opportunities to overcome many of these limitations. Here we review existing methods used to collect data on the movements and interactions of multiple animals in a natural setting. We then survey emerging technologies that are poised to revolutionize the study of collective animal behaviour by extending the spatial and temporal scales of inquiry, increasing data volume and quality, and expediting the post-processing of raw data. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Collective movement ecology’. }

    abstract = { Animal groups represent magnificent archetypes of self-organized collective behavior. As such, they have attracted enormous interdisciplinary interest in the last years. From a mechanistic point of view, animal aggregations remind physical systems of particles or spins, where the individual constituents interact locally, giving rise to ordering at the global scale. This analogy has fostered important research, where numerical and theoretical approaches from physics have been applied to models of self-organized motion. In this paper, we discuss how the physics methodology may provide precious conceptual and technical instruments in empirical studies of collective animal behavior. We focus on three-dimensional groups, for which empirical data have been extremely scarce until recently, and describe novel experimental protocols that allow reconstructing aggregations of thousands of individuals. We show how an appropriate statistical analysis of these large-scale data allows inferring important information on the interactions between individuals in a group, a key issue in behavioral studies and a basic ingredient of theoretical models. To this aim, we revisit the approach we recently used on starling flocks, and apply it to a much larger data set, never analyzed before. The results confirm our previous findings and indicate that interactions between birds have a topological rather than metric nature, each individual interacting with a fixed number of neighbors irrespective of their distances. }

The numerical model is based on behavioral rules for individuals in the school by considering attraction, repulsion, and parallel-orientation behavior. Each individual follows the same rules and makes school movements. The simulation results show that school order and flexibility are affected by the number of neighbors interacting with an individual in the school and by the randomness of individual motion. Increase in the number of interacting neighbors leads to high order, especially when the number increases from a low value (between one and three). An optimal number of interacting neighbors exists that is relatively low (two or three) for high flexibility, indicating that a fish needs only to pay attention to a few neighbors to realize both order and flexibility. The low randomness of individual motion benefits both order and flexibility. These results indicate that schooling fish have evolved specialized ability for establishing both school order and flexibility."

	abstract = {The desire to understand how the brain generates and patterns behavior has driven rapid methodological innovation to quantify and model natural animal behavior. This has led to important advances in deep learning-based markerless pose estimation that have been enabled in part by the success of deep learning for computer vision applications. Here we present SLEAP (Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses), a framework for multi-animal pose tracking via deep learning. This system is capable of simultaneously tracking any number of animals during social interactions and across a variety of experimental conditions. SLEAP implements several complementary approaches for dealing with the problems inherent in moving from single-to multi-animal pose tracking, including configurable neural network architectures, inference techniques, and tracking algorithms, enabling easy specialization and tuning for particular experimental conditions or performance requirements. We report results on multiple datasets of socially interacting animals (flies, bees, and mice) and describe how dataset-specific properties can be leveraged to determine the best configuration of SLEAP models. Using a high accuracy model (\&lt;2.8 px error on 95\% of points), we were able to track two animals from full size 1024 {\texttimes} 1024 pixel frames at up to 320 FPS.

	abstract = {In complex societies, individuals{\textquoteright} roles are reflected by interactions with other conspecifics. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) generally change tasks as they age, but developmental trajectories of individuals can vary drastically due to physiological and environmental factors. We introduce a succinct descriptor of an individual{\textquoteright}s social network that can be obtained without interfering with the colony. This network age accurately predicts task allocation, survival, activity patterns, and future behavior. We analyze developmental trajectories of multiple cohorts of individuals in a natural setting and identify distinct developmental pathways and critical life changes. Our findings suggest a high stability in task allocation on an individual level. We show that our method is versatile and can extract different properties from social networks, opening up a broad range of future studies. Our approach highlights the relationship of social interactions and individual traits, and provides a scalable technique for understanding how complex social systems function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Interaction patterns in human communication networks are characterized by intermittency and unpredictable timing (burstiness). Simulated spreading dynamics through such networks are slower than expected. A technology for automated recording of social interactions of individual honeybees, developed by the authors, enables one to study these two phenomena in a nonhuman society. Specifically, by analyzing more than 1.2 million bee social interactions, we demonstrate that burstiness is not a human-specific interaction pattern. We furthermore show that spreading dynamics on bee social networks are faster than expected, confirming earlier theoretical predictions that burstiness and fast spreading can co-occur. We expect that these findings will inform future models of large-scale social organization, spread of disease, and information transmission.Social networks mediate the spread of information and disease. The dynamics of spreading depends, among other factors, on the distribution of times between successive contacts in the network. Heavy-tailed (bursty) time distributions are characteristic of human communication networks, including face-to-face contacts and electronic communication via mobile phone calls, email, and internet communities. Burstiness has been cited as a possible cause for slow spreading in these networks relative to a randomized reference network. However, it is not known whether burstiness is an epiphenomenon of human-specific patterns of communication. Moreover, theory predicts that fast, bursty communication networks should also exist. Here, we present a high-throughput technology for automated monitoring of social interactions of individual honeybees and the analysis of a rich and detailed dataset consisting of more than 1.2 million interactions in five honeybee colonies. We find that bees, like humans, also interact in bursts but that spreading is significantly faster than in a randomized reference network and remains so even after an experimental demographic perturbation. Thus, while burstiness may be an intrinsic property of social interactions, it does not always inhibit spreading in real-world communication networks. We anticipate that these results will inform future models of large-scale social organization and information and disease transmission, and may impact health management of threatened honeybee populations.},
